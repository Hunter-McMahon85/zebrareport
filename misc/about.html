    <p>All football fans want in the game is honesty, however within recent years, it seems that the standards of officiating have declined
        to the level to which some fans are screaming that the NFL is rigged. In seeing this we decided that it is time for something to be done
        for some time now, Baseball fans have put together umpire report cards to score and judge how well games are called. Why not do the same for football? 
        That is why this project was started, so that NFL refs can be held to some level of accountability by the fans. <br>
        However bear in mind that refs are human and are thus inperfect therefore they may sometimes genuinely miss penalties etc. That said,
        even if a game may seem skewed towards one team, at the end of the day, theyre human and may not have intended to call the game in such a way.
